Painting Application using Kotlin
INTRODUCTION
Children often starts writing by sketching for a very first time on any white board. Which helps them to write any free hand sketch on that board. It could be any letter, number or any other sketch etc. It is very helpful for the children to draw free hand sketches in their infancy age. 
Problem Statement
No one start writing on the keyboard for the very first time. It is very hard for a child to type the letter or the number through keyboard. Every child starts writing for a very first time by free hand sketching of letter or number or any other thing. 
Solution
To overcome above problem statement, I have created an android application using kotlin programming language named as a “Paint Application”. In which, children can make any free hand design, painting or sketch by using different colored pen such as, red, black, blue, cyan etc. There is also a button which is used for erasing the current painting.
This is very helpful and interesting applications for the children to draw multiple things and erase them again and again. 
Project Details
I have used two types of layouts in this project, relative layout and linear layout. I have used Image Buttons for different colors. The objects of Path () and paint () are created. Canvas is also used for sketching on the white board.  onTouch and onDraw methods are also overridden.  

Project Working 
There are seven (7) buttons such as red, blue, black, cyan, brown, sky blue and white respectively. While clicking all buttons except white, there will be toast message containing info about the button that is clicked and the color of paintbrush will be according to button clicked. When user click on white button, it will work like eraser. It will erase all the sketch.
